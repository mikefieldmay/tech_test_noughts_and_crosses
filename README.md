Noughts & Crosses Tech Test!
===========================

The brief
---------

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

- There are two players in the game (X and O)
- Players take turns until the game is over
- A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
- A turn ends when a player claims a field
- A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
- A game is over if a player wins
- A game is over when all fields are taken

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

Need to develop the game class which has turns and the rule class which validates moves, win conditions etc. Plan to work on this in the near future.
